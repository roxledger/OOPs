What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","\n","  -  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects containing attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n","\n","\n","2.   What is a class in OOP?\n","\n","  -  Class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects that defines properties and behaviors.\n","\n","\n","3.  What is an object in OOP?\n","\n","  -   An instance of a class with defined attributes and methods.\n","\n","\n","4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation.\n","\n","  -  Abstraction: Hides implementation details, exposing only essential features.\n","  \n","  -  Encapsulation: Restricts direct access to object attributes, providing controlled modifications.\n","\n","\n","5.  What are dunder methods in Python?\n","\n","  -  Dunder Methods in Python: Special methods prefixed with \"__\" (e.g., __init__, __str__, __repr__) to customize object behavior.\n","\n","6.   Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","\n","  -  Inheritance in OOP enables a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.\n","\n","7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","\n","  -  Polymorphism allows methods to be implemented differently across multiple related classes, enhancing flexibility.\n","\n","8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","\n","  -  Encapsulation in Python is achieved using private (__var) and protected (_var) attributes to control access levels.\n","\n","9.  What is a constructor in Python?\n","\n","  -  Constructor (__init__) in Python is a special method that initializes object properties upon creation.\n","\n","10.  What are class and static methods in Python?\n","\n","  -  Class and static methods in Python are specialized functions within a class:\n","  \n","  **  Class Method (@classmethod):\n","      \n","      \n","      - Operates at the class level, not on instances.\n","      - Takes cls as its first parameter.\n","      - Can modify class attributes.\n","  \n","  \n","  ** Static Method (@staticmethod):\n","\n","    -  Works like a regular function inside a class.\n","    -  Takes no instance (self) or class (cls) reference.\n","    -  Used for utility functions related to the class.\n","\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","\n","  -  Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, Python achieves similar behavior using default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs)\n","\n","12.  What is method overriding in OOP?\n","\n","  -  Method Overriding refers to redefining a parent class method in a subclass to provide specialized behavior.\n","\n","\n","13.   What is a property decorator in Python?\n","\n","  -   The property decorator in Python allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, enhancing encapsulation and creating getter properties without needing explicit method calls.\n","\n","    Purpose of property:\n","    -  Encapsulates private attributes (_attribute).\n","    -  Allows controlled access and computed properties.\n","    -  Simplifies syntax, eliminating the need for obj.get_value().\n","\n","14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","\n","  -  Polymorphism Enhances code reuse and makes systems more adaptable.\n","\n","15.   What is an abstract class in Python?\n","\n","  -  Abstract Class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, requiring subclasses to implement abstract methods.\n","\n","16.  What are the advantages of OOP.\n","\n","  -  **Advantages of OOP in Python:**  \n","- **Encapsulation** - Restricts direct access to object attributes, ensuring controlled modifications.  \n","- **Modularity** – Organizes code into reusable classes, improving maintainability.  \n","- **Abstraction** – Hides implementation details, exposing only essential functionalities.  \n","- **Code Reusability** – **Inheritance** allows derived classes to reuse and extend functionality.  \n","- **Polymorphism** – Enables flexibility by allowing methods to take different forms.  \n","- **Scalability** – New features can be added without modifying existing code structures.  \n","- **Data Security** – Restricts unintended modifications using **private and protected attributes**.  \n","- **Better Collaboration** – Facilitates teamwork by keeping code modular and well-structured.  \n","\n","\n","17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","\n","  -  ### **Class Variable vs. Instance Variable**  \n","\n","**Class Variable**: Shared across all instances; defined at the class level.  \n","**Instance Variable**: Unique to each object; defined within `__init__`.  \n","\n","**Key Differences:**  \n","- **Scope**: Class variables apply globally, instance variables are object-specific.  \n","- **Modification**: Changing a class variable affects all instances; instance variable changes impact only that instance.  \n","- **Usage**: Class variables store shared attributes (e.g., count of objects), instance variables store distinct data.\n","\n","\n","18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","\n","  -  Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This enables code reuse but can lead to complexity due to the diamond problem (conflicts in method resolution).\n","\n","19.   Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n","\n","  -  __str__ vs. __repr__ Methods:\n","\n","-  __str__: Returns a human-readable string representation.\n","\n","-  __repr__: Provides an unambiguous object representation.\n","\n","\n","20.   What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","\n","  -  super() Function calls a parent class method from a subclass, avoiding redundant code.\n","\n","      It helps avoid redundant code, promotes code reusability, and ensures proper method resolution order (MRO) when multiple inheritance is used.\n","\n","\n","21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","  -  __del__ Method defines an object’s destruction behavior.\n","     \n","     Its primary purpose is to release resources and perform cleanup operations before the object is destroyed.\n","\n","22.   What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","\n","  -  **`@staticmethod` vs. `@classmethod` in Python:**  \n","- **`@classmethod`** – Operates on the class itself, takes `cls` as the first argument, and modifies class attributes.  \n","- **`@staticmethod`** – Works like a regular function inside a class, takes no `cls` or `self`, and is used for utility functions.\n","\n","23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","\n","  -  **Polymorphism in Python with Inheritance:**  \n","- **Method Overriding:** A subclass redefines a method from its parent class to provide specialized behavior.  \n","- **Unified Interface:** Objects of different classes can be used interchangeably if they inherit from the same base class.  \n","- **Dynamic Behavior:** The appropriate method is called **at runtime**, depending on the object type.  \n","- **Advantage:** Enables different objects to override methods while maintaining a consistent interface.\n","\n","24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","\n","  -   Method Chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single statement.\n","  - Each method returns self, allowing further method calls.\n","  - Improves readability, reduces redundant code, and enables fluent API design.\n","\n","25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","\n","- **Enables callable objects** – Allows an instance to be used like a function.  \n","- **Enhances flexibility** – Used in decorators and functional programming.  \n","- **Encapsulation** – Maintains state while providing dynamic behavior.
